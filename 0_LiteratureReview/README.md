# Literature Review

Approaches or solutions that have been tried before on similar projects.


This project milestone requires you to review the literature related to your project. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the problem domain, as well as to identify similar approaches or solutions that have been tried before.
You might want to answer the following questions:
  * Which are the models commonly used for my problem?
  * Which format must the training data have?
  * How much training data is typically used in similar problems?
  * Are there pretrained models I can use for my problem?
